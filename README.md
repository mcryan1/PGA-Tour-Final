Analyzing the major year end stats from the PGA tour to determine what stats were the best predictors of year end rank

## Data Source

The data is from the PGA tour website, which is comparing the major year end  statistics of the top 125 golfers* of the year. The top 125 golfers were analyzed due to this being the regulation cutoff.


*there were roughly 5 exlusions from the top 125 due to some players not playing enough rounds to qualify for PGA stats meausurements.(Tiger Woods, Shane Lowry, Matt Wolff etc.)
